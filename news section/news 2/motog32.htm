<div class="second-para">The Moto G32 from Motorola has been found in the database of the Thai authority's website. The listing confirms that it will be a 4G LTE-enabled device, suggesting it towards being a mid-range offering. The certification hasn't revealed anything regarding the specifications of the alleged Moto G32. Previous reports have indicated that the Moto G32 will be a rebranded version of the Moto E32 for markets like India.</div>
<div class="third-para">If the Moto E32 indeed launches as the Moto G32 globally, we can expect the latter to come with a sleek design. The handset could have a punch-hole design to house the selfie camera. At the rear, the device will have a triple primary camera module, while there will be a fingerprint sensor hidden below the power button on the right side. Software-wise, the phone could boot Android 11 out-of-the-box.</div>
